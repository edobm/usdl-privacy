Linked USDL
Linked USDL (initial version: Unified Service Description Language) was developed for describing business and software services using computer-readable and computer­-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet, by comprising modules (e.g. usdl-core) where each module targeting a specific aspect.

Alongside with the business specifications, privacy has a crucial role in the services description. Personal data agreement properties should describe the privacy categorization that is applied onto the data that are provided, shared and utilized within the service and provide answers to the following questions.

How are data categorized into information types?

Which data is exactly collected (detailed specification)?

Who can access these data (which information type)?

Which actions describe each actor purpose (related with the data utlization and processing)?

Privacy module for Linked USDL
Through the implementation of the privacy module tool, we focused on tackling the privacy questions mentioned above - by categorizing the data into two main types of information and extending the basic usdl-core module by defining new business roles that describe each actor's role and interaction with the data at hand.
